## Introduction
This repository contains all of my files for the first programming assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data class.  Files included are:

run_analysis.R,  contains a script that generates a tidy data set from the
UCI HAR dataset.  The script should be run in a directory that contains the "UCI HAR dataset" directory and assumes that file names and locations have not been altered.  

Tidy.txt, contains the dataset created by run_anlaysis.R.  

CodeBook.md contains a description of the contents of the Tidy.txt file
